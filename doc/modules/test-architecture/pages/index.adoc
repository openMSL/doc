= OSMP Test Architecture

The OSMP Test Architecture is designed to test any simulation model complying to the https://github.com/OpenSimulationInterface/osi-sensor-model-packaging[OSMP] specification.
A variety of model types from environmental effect models over sensor models to traffic participant models can be tested with this architecture.
The architecture is divided into 3 main test levels based on the credibility assessment level definition by Ahmann et al.{fn-disclaimer}.
Because the test architecture is specifically designed for OpenMSL open source models, a license check is needed.
The license check is preceding the 3 main credibility assessment levels as level 0.
This yields the following credibility assessment level line-up:

- CL 0: xref:cl0.adoc[License Check]
- CL 1: xref:cl1.adoc[Code Verification]
- CL 2: xref:cl2.adoc[Qualitative Verification]
- CL 3: xref:cl3.adoc[Quantitative Verification]

Every credibility assessment level is tested with a separate GitHub action and is further described in the following sections.
