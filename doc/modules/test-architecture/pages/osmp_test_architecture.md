## CL X: Validation

(not yet implemented) <br>
A future credibility assessment level might constitute the validation of the model against real world data.
In pre-defined validation scenarios, the model output is compared to measured sensor data with suitable metrics.
A similar test setup as in CL 3 might be applied.
